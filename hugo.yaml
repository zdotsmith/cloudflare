    content: |-
      I'm deeply curiosity about how things work and have a strong drive to create. While my foundation is in Mechanical Engineering, I consider myself a multi-disciplinary builder. My background combines core engineering principles with practical skills in Product Design, Programming (including Python, MATLAB, C++), and 3D Modelling (SolidWorks, CAD, Blender).
      I'm also a keen Programmer, using languages like Python and C++ to solve problems and automate tasks. This technical side extends to my interest in Self-Hosting, where I enjoy building and managing my own digital environments. And when I step away from the screen, you might find me exploring the world through the lens of my camera as a Photographer.
      Ultimately, I'm passionate about learning and applying modern technologies to build useful, interesting, and efficient things.
